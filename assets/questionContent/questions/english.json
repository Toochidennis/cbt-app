    "passage": "Read the passage carefully and answer the questions that follow.\n\nThe honeybee includes a group of insects that in a broad sense comprises all bees that make honey. They are social insects and live together in hives. The honeybee is remarkable for the dancing movement it performs in the hive to communicate information to its fellow bees about the location, distance, size, and quality of a particular food source in the surrounding area. There are two honeybee sexes, male and female, and two female castes. The two female castes are known as workers and queens. The males, or drones, are larger than the workers and are present only for about eight weeks, in early summer. The workers and queen have stingers, whereas the drones are stingless. The queens' unfertilised eggs develop into drones, whereas fertilised eggs develop into females, which may be either workers or virgin queens. Eggs destined to become queens are deposited in queen cells. After hatching, the virgin queens are fed royal jelly. When not fed a diet consisting solely of royal jelly, virgin queens will develop into workers. \n\nAdapted from Britannica, T. Editors of Encyclopedia (2020, March 24), honeybee.

If you are not sure of what to say back, why not just say \"same to you\" – I ask for no more.\n\nOur successes are conditioned by the amount of risk we are about to take. Earlier today, I visited a local farmer about five kilometers from where I live. He could not have been 55, but he said he was already too old to farm vigorously. He still suffered, he said, from the energy he displayed as a farmer in his younger days. Around his hut were two pepperbushes. There were cocoyam growing around him. There were snail shells which had given him meat. There must have been more snails around the banana trees than I saw. He hardly ever went to town to buy things. He was self-sufficient. The car, the television or radio and the newspaper were things he could live without. He had no ambition whatsoever, he told me.\n\nI am not sure if you are already envious of him, but were we all to revert to such a life, we would be driven back like aimless sheep to cave dwelling. On the other hand, try to put yourself in the shoes of the Russian or American astronauts. Any moment you are shot into space, you have to be mentally alert, else, if you forget what to do, one of the things that might happen to you is that you could forever become a satellite going round until you die of starvation, and even then, your dead body would continue the gyration.\n\nNaturally, they may have some slight foreboding on the contingency of their non-return. However, it is their courage for going in spite of these apprehensions that makes the world hail them so loudly today.\n(Akinyemi, A., Olupe, F., & Adetutu, S.

    "passage": "Read the following passage and answer the questions below:\n\nChristopher Marlowe, the son of Marlowe who is described as the clerk of St Mary's in the city of Canterbury, was born in 1564. He received his early education at The King's School in that city. He took the degrees of B.A. and M.A. in 1583 and 1587 respectively from Cambridge University. He started writing poems and became a renowned dramatist in the Admiral's Company.\n\nMarlowe is known as one of the university wits, a group of dramatists along with Robert Greene, Thomas Nash, and George Peele. Marlowe is considered the greatest precursor to Shakespeare. When Marlowe came upon the English stage, the nature of drama was undeveloped. The verses in the dramas were lifeless. But Marlowe gave English drama an appropriate meter, diction, and method. It is really a matter of speculation what kind of greatness he would have achieved if his life had not been terminated (C++) in a duel after a brawl in a tavern (inn).\n\nThe literary life of Marlowe had a short span, from 1587 to 1593. During this period, he wrote five plays which were all tragedies as he had no comic vein. His tragedies like Dr Faustus, The Jew of Malta, and Edward Il are rated as some of the best works of the Elizabethan age. He also wrote an unfinished poem Hero and Leander and translated some parts of Ovid's (a Roman Poet) elegies.\n\nMarlowe's subjects are mostly heroic which appeals to the imagination of the play-goers. His heroes epitomize the spirit of the Renaissance. Each of them embodies a passion and tries to achieve lies in his development of the blank verse. He put it at any cost. But Marlowe's chief contribution aside from the old rhyming lines then employed in the plays and used blank verse. Thus, the language of drama was brought closer to real life and drama was made ready for Shakespeare (1564-1616) to improve upon it. It is rightly said, \"No Marlowe, no Shakespeare\".",
