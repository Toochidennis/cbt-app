It occurs through stomata, which are tiny pores on the surface of leaves that allow plants to exchange gases with the atmosphere. Transpiration also occurs through evaporation from the surfaces of leaves, stems, and flowers. Guttation also involves water loss but there is difference between the two.\n\nTranspiration is the process where plants lose water vapour through tiny pores called stomata on their leaves, while guttation is the release of liquid water droplets from specialized structures called hydathodes, usually located on the edges of leaves, occurring when the plant absorbs water faster than it can transpire, creating a pressure that forces the water out; essentially, transpiration is water loss as vapour, and guttation is water loss as liquid droplets. \n\nTranslocation is the process by which plants move dissolved materials, like sugars and nutrients, throughout the plant. \n\nEvaporation\" in plants refers to the process called transpiration, where water absorbed by the plant roots travels through the plant's vascular system and exits as water vapour through tiny pores on the leaves called stomata.",
